Application Tracking Utility Functions

This module will contain utilities for application tracking and management, currently located in model_utils.py.
Will be split from model_utils.py as the codebase grows beyond MVP stage.

Future functionality:
- Follow-up timing calculations
- Application metrics and analytics
- Status tracking and updates
- Interview scheduling helpers
- Communication history tracking
