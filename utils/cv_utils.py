CV Utility Functions

This module will contain utilities for CV/Resume data processing, currently located in model_utils.py.
Will be split from model_utils.py as the codebase grows beyond MVP stage.

Future functionality:
- Experience merging
- Total experience calculation
- Skills analysis
- Education formatting
- CV parsing and validation
