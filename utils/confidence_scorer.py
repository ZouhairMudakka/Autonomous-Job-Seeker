"""
confidence_scorer.py

This module is responsible for computing a confidence score for AI-driven actions,
using both heuristic (historical success/failure data) and optional GPT-based logic.
It is intended to work with the 'learning_pipeline.py' module to gather past outcomes
and refine the scoring process. Currently, it contains placeholders for advanced logic.

Potential Usage:
----------------
1. In ai_navigator.py (or your agent files), call:
   scorer = ConfidenceScorer(learning_pipeline=...)
   confidence = await scorer.compute_confidence(action, context)
2. This score determines whether to proceed, retry, or fallback.

Note:
-----
- GPT-based confidence scoring is optional and not fully implemented. You can
  integrate OpenAI or other LLM calls if you want advanced logic.
- Heuristic logic can be as simple as referencing success/failure counts from
  the learning pipeline.

TODO (AI Integration):
- Implement GPT-based confidence scoring
- Add proper OpenAI API integration
- Setup confidence threshold calibration
- Add context-aware scoring logic
- Integrate with learning_pipeline.py
- Add performance monitoring
