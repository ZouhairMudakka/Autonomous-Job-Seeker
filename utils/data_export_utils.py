Data Export Utility Functions

This module will contain utilities for data export and reporting, currently located in model_utils.py.
Will be split from model_utils.py as the codebase grows beyond MVP stage.

Future functionality:
- CSV export for applications
- Detailed application reports
- Analytics data export
- Timeline visualization data
- Custom report generation
