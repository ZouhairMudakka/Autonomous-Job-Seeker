Job Matching Utility Functions

This module will contain utilities for job matching and scoring, currently located in model_utils.py.
Will be split from model_utils.py as the codebase grows beyond MVP stage.

Future functionality:
- Job-profile match scoring
- Skills compatibility analysis
- Experience level matching
- Location and work mode compatibility
- Salary range validation
