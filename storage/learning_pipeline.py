learning_pipeline.py

This module stores and updates success/failure data for AI-driven actions,
enabling a basic "learning pipeline" for confidence scoring. Currently unimplemented
and serving as a placeholder for future expansions.

Potential Usage:
----------------
1. Record outcomes of AI actions (success/failure, confidence score).
2. Compute simple success rates or other heuristics for each action type.
3. (Phase 2+) Load/Save data to persistent storage (CSV, JSON, DB).
4. (Phase 3+) Integrate more advanced techniques (e.g., training ML models).

Note:
-----
- This file is not yet fully implemented. It's a placeholder where we'll gradually
  build out logic to refine confidence calculations over time.
- We assume that each "action" is a named operation (e.g., "click_apply_button"),
  and we store success/failure data, confidence, timestamps, etc.

TODO (AI Integration):
- Implement persistent storage for action outcomes
- Add success/failure tracking mechanisms
- Integrate with confidence_scorer.py
- Add metrics calculation (success rates, confidence thresholds)
- Setup data cleanup and archival logic
- Add export/import functionality for training data
