## Overview
This system uses multiple specialized AI agents to:
- Search and analyze job postings
- Match job requirements with user qualifications
- Automate application form filling
- Track application status and interactions
- Handle authentication and security
- Manage rate limits and platform compliance

    %% Top-level - Testing sync workflow
    %% Added this comment to trigger sync
    Controller(( Controller ))
    TaskManager(( TaskManager ))

    %% Agents
    LinkedInAgent[(LinkedInAgent)]
    AINavigator[(AI Navigator)]
    CredentialsAgent[(CredentialsAgent)]
    FormFillerAgent[(FormFillerAgent)]
    CVParserAgent[(CVParserAgent)]
    GeneralAgent[(GeneralAgent)]
    TrackerAgent[(TrackerAgent)]
    UserProfileAgent[(UserProfileAgent)]

    %% Controller coordinates everything
    Controller -- Schedules Tasks --> TaskManager
    Controller -- "Use domain logic" --> LinkedInAgent
    Controller -- "Call sub-agents on demand" --> CredentialsAgent
    Controller -- "Log steps" --> TrackerAgent

    %% TaskManager can call tasks that eventually go to LinkedInAgent or other agents
    TaskManager -- "Async tasks" --> LinkedInAgent
    TaskManager -- "Async tasks" --> CredentialsAgent
    TaskManager -- "Async tasks" --> FormFillerAgent

    %% LinkedInAgent can call sub-agents
    LinkedInAgent -- "Handle login/captcha" --> CredentialsAgent
    LinkedInAgent -- "Form filling" --> FormFillerAgent
    LinkedInAgent -- "Parse CV if needed" --> CVParserAgent
    LinkedInAgent -- "Generic DOM steps" --> GeneralAgent
    LinkedInAgent -- "Confidence-based nav?" --> AINavigator

    %% Logging is usually done by everyone -> TrackerAgent
    LinkedInAgent -- "Log outcomes" --> TrackerAgent
    CredentialsAgent -- "Log captcha events" --> TrackerAgent
    FormFillerAgent -- "Log fill steps" --> TrackerAgent

    %% UserProfileAgent is mostly a data store
    Controller -- "Manage user preferences" --> UserProfileAgent
    LinkedInAgent -- "Read user preferences" --> UserProfileAgent
```

### Sequence Flow Example

    autonumber
    participant UI as User/CLI
    participant C as Controller
    participant T as TaskManager
    participant LA as LinkedInAgent
    participant CA as CredentialsAgent
    participant FF as FormFillerAgent
    participant TK as TrackerAgent

    UI->>C: "Run LinkedIn Flow (job_title, location)"
    note over C: Possibly read user_profile info or <br> do an AI Master-Plan
    C->>T: create/run task (search_jobs_and_apply)
    T->>LA: search_jobs_and_apply(job_title, location)

    LA->>TK: log "Starting job search"
    LA->>CA: (if captcha or login needed) handle_captcha/login
    CA->>TK: log "captcha solved / login complete"
    LA->>FF: fill forms for "Easy Apply"
    FF->>TK: log "Form fields filled"
    LA->>TK: log "Job applied or skipped"
    T->>C: job_search_and_apply done
    C->>TK: log_activity "Flow success"
    note over C: Then more flows or end_session
